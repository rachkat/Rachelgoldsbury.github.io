In this report, we present audience-specific visualizations created using Microsoft Power BI, leveraging data on automotive safety recalls. The goal is to provide tailored insights for three distinct audiences: **Government Regulators**, **Automobile Manufacturers**, and the **General Public/Consumers**.

## Visualizations  

### 1. Government Regulators  
**Visualization:** This line chart illustrates the trend of affected units over time, filtered to exclude data before 1960 for relevance.  

**Analysis:** This visualization aids Government Regulators in identifying patterns and focusing on specific periods or severity levels that may require intervention. The filtered data ensures relevance to current safety concerns.

### 2. Automobile Manufacturers  
**Visualization:** Bar chart displaying the count of components with defects and their names, filtered to exclude components with less than 200 counts.  

**Analysis:** Targeted at Automobile Manufacturers, this visualization guides them in focusing on specific components prone to defects. By filtering out less prevalent issues, manufacturers can prioritize their efforts for maximum impact.

### 3. General Public/Consumers  
**Visualization:** Bar chart sorted by make and count of defects, providing insights into the competence of manufacturers for safety and functionality.  

**Analysis:** Tailored for the General Public/Consumers, this visualization empowers them to make informed decisions. By highlighting manufacturers with fewer defects, consumers can choose vehicles with higher safety and functionality ratings.

## Audience Needs  

In addressing the contrasting needs of our three target audiences, we recognize distinct priorities for each group.  

- **Government Regulators**, in their oversight role, necessitate a comprehensive overview that facilitates the identification of trends and patterns over time and also peaks in problems that may indicate negligence, enabling effective regulatory intervention.  
- For **Automobile Manufacturers**, the focus is on precise information pertaining to specific components with defects. This requirement allows manufacturers to streamline their recall strategies with a tailored approach, optimizing resources and addressing critical issues promptly.  
- The **General Public and Consumers** seek a user-friendly display that facilitates easy comparison between manufacturers. Their emphasis lies on making informed decisions regarding vehicle safety and functionality.  

Considering the familiarity and varied characteristics among our target audiences, we acknowledge the diverse backgrounds they bring to the data interpretation process.  

- Government regulators, familiar with technical terminology and industry standards, possess the expertise to delve into intricate details.  
- Automobile manufacturers, while possessing technical know-how, may benefit from clear and actionable insights that align with their industry-specific knowledge—for example, knowing specifically where to focus their resources.  
- The general public and consumers, representing a broad spectrum of educational levels, age groups, and cultural backgrounds, require simplified information to grasp the complexities of automotive safety recalls, which is why their visualization focuses on practical decisions about cars.  

Striking a balance between technical accuracy and accessibility ensures that our visualizations effectively communicate with each audience segment.

## Data Visualization Methods  

In selecting data visualization methods tailored to our diverse audience needs, we carefully considered the strengths and weaknesses of each audience and visual representation.  

- The **line chart**, designed for Government Regulators, stands out in highlighting trends and patterns over time. This dynamic visualization allows regulators to discern evolving patterns in recall data, facilitating timely interventions. However, its weakness lies in its limited ability to provide detailed insights into specific components, potentially hindering a more granular understanding of issues.  

- For **Automobile Manufacturers**, the bar chart emerges as a strategic choice due to its clear presentation of counts for components with defects. This method aids prioritization by providing a straightforward overview of the most critical issues. Nevertheless, its weakness lies in its potential to overlook the broader trend or severity of issues, as it primarily focuses on individual component counts rather than capturing the overall recall landscape.  

- In catering to the needs of the **General Public and Consumers**, a sorted bar chart was chosen for its simplicity, enabling easy comparison between manufacturers. The strength of this method lies in its user-friendly nature, allowing consumers to make informed decisions regarding vehicle safety and functionality. However, the weakness lies in its potential lack of granularity for technical assessments, as it prioritizes accessibility over detailed technical insights.  

These visualizations are crafted with an understanding of the unique needs of Government Regulators, Automobile Manufacturers, and the General Public/Consumers. By leveraging appropriate visualization methods, we aim to provide actionable insights tailored to each audience, fostering informed decision-making in the realm of automotive safety recalls.
