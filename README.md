# Rachel Goldsbury â€” Data Analytics & Insights Blog

This repository contains the source for my GitHub Pages site (Jekyll) where I share quick write-ups, visuals, and portfolio notes on **data analytics**.

ðŸ‘‰ **Live site:** https://rachkat.github.io

## Whatâ€™s here
- `_posts/` â€” blog posts (Markdown)
- `assets/` â€” images & charts
- `index.md` â€” homepage
- `_config.yml` â€” site settings

## Add a post (quick)
Create a file in `_posts/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` with this header:
```yaml

layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "1â€“2 sentence summary."
tags: [analytics, python, visualization]

Write your content below. Images go in `assets/img/` and are referenced like:

```markdown
![Alt text](./assets/img/your-image.png)
```
